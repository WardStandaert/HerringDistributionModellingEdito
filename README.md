# SpeciesDistributionModellingEdito

This tutorial is a showcase of how Edito can be used to create habitat suitability models.
The tutorial makes use of EditoTools.R, which contains functions to retrieve data from zarr and parquet files in the data lake.
For more information on EditoTools.R visit [the documentation](https://github.com/WardStandaert/EditoTools_documentation). 

# Tutorial outline

The different steps from data retrieval to modelling and creating figures are explained in the RMarkdown document.

# Getting started
There are two options:
- Open the .Rmd file and run the code chunk by chunk for a detailed modelling experience.\
- Alternatively, open the prerendered .html file that gives a nice overview of all steps of the modelling.

Happy modelling!
